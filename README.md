# E-Portfolio
Here are concrete projects and tasks I have worked on that are aimed at the IT sector. 
Everything from different programming language tasks to large-scale projects such as mobile applications, and web development with LLM integration. 
The majority of the data is from the Master of Science in Information Technology program at KTH, but please note that some projects may have been assigned by other universities.
Leisure projects may also occur. 
However, all the code and implementation shown is written in whole or in part by me in collaboration with other students depending on the work task. 
For navigation:
Go to any repository that has a descriptive name about what it is about, you can see all the different topics within IT as well as projects and course assignments that show concrete knowledge in the IT area.
